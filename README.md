### Summary
45.45% of reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program are 5-star, while 52.23% of reviews written by those who are not members of the paid Amazon Vine program are 5-star.  This does not show positivity bias based on the reviewer's membership in the paid Amazon Vine program.

For further analysis, running measures of central tendency (mean, median and mode) for the Vine/Non-Vine groups is recommended.
